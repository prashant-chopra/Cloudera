FLUME INTRODUCTION
------------------

Flume is generally used to ingest streaming data into HDFS. Eg: Web Logs

#Architecture

On the source system there needs to be an flume agent
which will pull the web logs

This will channel the data from agent to flume agent
on target system gateway node which will load data into HDFS.

Web Server---->Source---->Channel---->Sink---->HDFS

There are different architecture:
1) Multiple agents architecture
2) Consolidation architecture
3) Multiplexing architecture

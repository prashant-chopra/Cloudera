HIVE INTRODUCTION
=================
Hive is generally installed on Gateway Node, which has
-Hadoop Binaries
-Configuration files

BUT THIS WILL NOT RUN THE DAMEON PROCESSES.

When Hive is installed, we:
1) Install Hive Binaries
2) Setup Hive metastore DB
3) Configure to explain where Hadoop cluster and Hive metastore db are.

Configuration file "hive-site.xml"
provides information where HDFS cluster is and where metastore is.
hive.metastore.warehouse.dir parameter defines default database location

HIVE METASTORE IS CREATED IN RDBMS (Eg MySQL)
- On CDH this can be viewed in MySQL using -u hive -p cloudera
- database name "metastore"
- Some tables : TBLS, COLUMNS_V2

When a table is created in HIVE:
- Metadata of the table goes to METASTORE
- Table data goes to HDFS

TO view value of a hive parameter or to change its value use SET:
- set mapreduce.job.reduce;
- set mapreduce.job.reduce=2;
This will set the value for current session only.

To make this applicable for all the sessions
$HOME> vi .hiverc
and provide the value

When a query is fired against a table in HIVE
- Hive Binaries on gateway node will compile the query using Java APIs.
- Once compiled it will create a JAR file. This jar will be submitted as
  MR job into hadoop cluster.
- At the time of compilation it will know where on Hadoop cluster data is
  from metastore information, but it will not go and check at that point.
- This MR job will apply the structure to the data in HDFS and process it.

SIGNIFICANCE OF HIVE METASTORE:
Data and Metadata are stored separately in hive unlike RDBMS (Eg Oracle).
The biggest benefit from this technique is that multiple tools can be used
to process the underlying data.
1) Hive, which uses hive binaries to create MR jobs to run against data
2) Spark, which will use its own spark binaries (and not hive binaries)
   to process data using HiveContext in Spark
3) Impala, which can be used to directly query data in HDFS without MR job.

### HIVE CLI ###
################
Hive can be launched in 3 possible ways:
1) hive (launches command line)
2) hive -e (executed individual command w/o launching CLI)
3) hive -f (to ececute a file containing series of hive commands)

### HIVE LOGS ###
#################

By default hive creates log file at $HOME/tmp/${user}

This can be overridden using (-hiveconf or set)
- hive.log.dir
- hive.log.file
- hive.querylog.location

#To invoke IMPALA shell use

$>impala-shell

Try executing same query on BIG table with HIVE and IMPALA, you will find
difference in execution time as IMPALA will be faster.

This is because IMPALA does not create any MR job.

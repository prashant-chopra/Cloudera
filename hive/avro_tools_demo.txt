Generating AVRO Schema from AVRO datafile using AVRO TOOLS
==========================================================

1) Import all tables from retail_db to HIVE database warehouse location
   for retail_avro database

Create a folder on local FS as avro, and execute below command from inside
this dir as this command will create some java files and avro schema file
at the location from it is executed.

sqoop import-all-tables \
--connect "jdbc:mysql://quickstart.cloudera:3306/retail_db" \
--username retail_dba \
--password cloudera \
--as-avrodatafile \
--warehouse-dir /user/hive/warehouse/retail_avro.db/

NOTE: As we are not doing HIVE import but just dumping files onto hive
      warehouse location, there won't be any corresponding tables in
      hive database.

2) Once import is complete move departments avro file to local FS
We will use avro file in departments directory to extract schema information

hdfs dfs -get /user/hive/warehouse/retail_avro.db/departments .

Once the dir is copied, if you try to view the contents of the file it
will be garbled.

DATA IN AVRO IS PRESENTED IN JSON FORMAT

AVRO TOOLS
==========

1) To extract schema information from a avro file

avro-tools getmeta departments.avro
avro-tools getschema departments.avro

2) To convert into JSON and save in another file

avro-tools tojson departments.avro > departments.json

3) To convert JSON file into avro

avro-tools fromjson departments.avro --schema-file departments.avsc

NOTE: When converting to AVRO format --schema-file parameter is mandatory
      else it wont know the format of the data.

NOT SURE IF TOTEXT/FROMTEXT WORKS

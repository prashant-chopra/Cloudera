gitHIVE TUTORIAL
=============

# Difference with RDBMS
1) No support for real time indexes
2) No Packages or procedures or functions
3) No Triggers
4) Partitioning available but NO range partitioning
   - In terms of Oracle there are 3 types of partitioning techniques:
     LIST - This is partitioning in hive
     HASH - This is bucketing in hive
     RANGE- Not available with hive
5) Limited data types (numeric, string, binary etc.)

HIVE DDL
========

create database if not exists retail_ods;
create database of not exists retail_edw;

Types of tables:
1) Managed table - When drop a managed table, HDFS directory is also deleted.
2) External table - When drop a external table, only metadata from hive
                    metastore is deleted. HDFS dir and files still remain.

Why use EXTERNAL TABLE:
If a table data is being used by multiple tools, if its a managed table and
table is dropped, all the tools are affected as data is lost. Thus use external
table in such scenarios.

Physical Data Modeling in HIVE
==============================
1) Take care of the file format in which data needs to be stored
2) Convert data types to as supported in hive
3) Determine delimiters (field and line)
4) Determine value for NULL values
5) Handle data redundancy
6) Determine Partitioning/Bucketing strategy
7) Too much partitioning vs. too little partitioning

Eg : Too much partitioning means many small files, which is not good for hadoop
Too little partitioning means ETL/Reporting can go slow.

EXTRACT AND LOAD - HIVE
=======================

Data can be coming from different sources like
-RDBMS (Oracle etc)
-Closed (Mainframe etc)
-External (XML, JSON etc)

Strategies for extract and load
-Push (need to use hive or write custom MR)
-Pull (can use sqoop)
-Filter as much as possible and as early as possible

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SQOOP can be used to load data from RDBMS
HIVE can be used to load data already extracted to HDFS in form of flat files
MR job can be used to extend capabilities to load process

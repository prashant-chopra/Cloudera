DATA FORMATS
============

#### TEXT FILE
- Basic file type, which can be read virtually from any language.
- Human readable so easy for debugging
- Representing numeric values as string wastes space

VERDICT : Good interoperability, Poor performance

#### SEQUENCE FILE
- Stores key value pairs in binary format
- Capable of storing binary data
- Format is java specific and is tightly coupled with Hadoop

VERDICT : Good performance, Poor interoperability

#### AVRO FILE
- Efficient due to optimized binary encoding
- Can read write from many languages
- Embeds schema in the file, so will always be readable
- Schema evolution can accommodate changes
- Best choice for general purpose storage in Hadoop

VERDICT : Excellent interoperability and performance.

#### PARQUET FILE
- Schema is embedded in file
- Reduces storage space
- Increases performance

VERDICT : Excellent interoperability and performance.

NOTE :
-BOTH AVRO AND PARQUET serializes data using highly optimized binary encoding.
-AVRO supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
-Flume uses AVRO for internal communication
